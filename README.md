## FAQ

**Is this cheating?**
No. PACDeluxe only improves performance - it does not modify gameplay, read hidden information, or provide any competitive advantage. All game logic runs on the official servers.

**Will I get banned?**
PACDeluxe does not violate any game rules. It's simply a different way to access the same game.

**Do I need a separate account?**
No. Use your existing Google login.

**Can I still play with browser users?**
Yes. You connect to the same servers and play with everyone.
